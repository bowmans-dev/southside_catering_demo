## Work in progress:
## Southside-Catering
- A mock up layout, working on the functional requirements for the Southside-Catering home & menu pages.
- Design is purposed for instantly swappable menu items and live announcements.
- This is demonstrated by editing text document menus in the local folder.

#### Testing this mock up requires no packages or dependencies.
#### Feel free to clone this project or download the zip to test this locally in the environment of your choice.
#### I am using Live Server extension in vscode.
#### Change the text documents content to test the swappable menu items.
