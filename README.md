## Work in progress:
## Southside-Catering Home & Menu Pages 
- A mock up layout, working on the functional requirements for the Southside-Catering Home & Menu pages.
- Made to be simple & adaptable to changing context & business requirements.
- Design is purposed to enable instantly swappable menu items and live announcements.
- This is being demonstrated by editing text document menus for the dedicated iframes.

- Testing this mock up requires no packages or dependencies.
- Feel free to clone this project or download the zip to test this locally in the environment of your choice.
- I am personally using Live Server extension in vscode.
- Change the text documents content and hit refresh to test the swappable menu items.
